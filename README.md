# ATM_action
Python program to deal with customers requests using an ATM machine
Working on the READme file (sorry)

This is what this program does:

1.Print a main menu to ask the user different options for displaying the bank account balance, for
depositing money, to withdraw money, and to exit from the ATM.
-Re-use the ATM menu options across the program to ask the user if he/she would like to perform another
operation on the bank account (using a loop)
- Ask the user a PIN to access to the ATM menu once the PIN is correct otherwise ask the user to try again
(using a loop).
2. Prompt the user to enter an option:
• If ‘1’ is entered, display the current balance and return to main menu.
• If ‘2’ is entered, print a sub-menu with withdrawal amounts Enter an option:
• If ‘3’ is selected check that the requested withdrawal is allowed, print a message to
show that the money has been withdrawn, calculate the new balance and return to main menu.
• If ‘4’ is entered, print a goodbye message and exit (break).
• If another value is entered, print an error message and print the menu again.
